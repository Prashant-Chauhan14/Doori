# Doori - The Social Distancing Tracker built using Computer Vision

In the current Covid-19 situation, safety measures taken by the governments around the world have failed in front of Covid-19, due to lack of social distancing practice.

Newer variants of the virus have emerged that are equivalent or more dangerous than the previous one. Thus, it becomes a monumental challenge to tackle the issue of social distancing in an overly populated country like India. 

__Doori__ aims to create a real-time social distance monitoring software so that administrators can use them to locate breach of bio-bubbles. It uses OpenCV library and YOLO v3 for real-time human detection.
